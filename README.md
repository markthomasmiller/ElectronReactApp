# ElectronReactApp

A boilerplate template for an Electron + React app. Supports locally-scoped CSS Modules by default (look in app/src/components/Link for an example) and hot reloading.

## How to install

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/zvphy/ElectronReactApp

# Enter the project
cd ElectronReactApp

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## How to run

Open one prompt and run:

```bash
# This allows hot reloading
$ npm run dev
```

Open another prompt and run:

```bash
# Starts the Electron app
$ npm start
```
