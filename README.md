# ElectronReactApp

A simple starting point for an Electron + React + Webpack app. Supports locally-scoped CSS Modules by default (look in app/src/components/Link for an example), hot reloading, and other nice features with a very small footprint to start.

## How To install

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/zvphy/ElectronReactApp

# Go into the repository
$ cd electron-react-webpack

# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

## How to run

Run these two commands in two different prompts to start developing with hot reloading.

```bash
# Webpack builds once and watches for changes to apply
$ npm run dev

# Start electron app
$ npm start
```
